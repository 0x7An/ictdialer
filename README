ICTDialer is based on Plivo Framework. 
So you need to setup and run freeswitch provided by Plivo.org. 
Instructions on how to install Freeswitch are given 
at http://www.plivo.org/get-started/ and repeated here for your convenience:

* Download and run the FreeSWITCH installer on your system
  Note: Currently, this installer is tested on CentOS > 5.5 and Debian-based distros.
    # wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/plivo/plivo/raw/master/freeswitch/install.sh
    # chmod +x install.sh
    # ./install.sh

* Run FreeSWITCH
  Run in Foreground
  # ./usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch
  Run in Background
  # ./usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch -nc


Setup and Run Plivo Framework
-----------------------------

Plivo without Fax support
-------------------------
  By default, Plivo Framework do not support sending and receiving Fax. 
  If you do not require Fax broadcast support in ICTDialer then 
  you can continue to install Plivo provided by Plivo.org Team as given below:
  
* Download and run the Plivo Framework installer on your system
  Note: Currently, Plivo Framework is tested on CentOS > 5.5 and Debian-based distros.
    # wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/plivo/plivo/raw/master/scripts/plivo_install.sh
    # chmod +x plivo_install.sh
    # ./plivo_install.sh /usr/local/plivo/
* Run Plivo
    # /etc/init.d/plivo start

Plivo with Fax support
----------------------
  However, if you want Fax support in ICTDialer then you should use 
  our version of open source Plivo. Download and extract ictdialer.tar.gz archive.
  Locate the folder "plivo-devel" in the extracted ICTdialer directory.

  1. Stop plivo service (if any) and clear /usr/local/plivo

  2. Copy and Paste plivo-devel folder in /usr/

  3. Go to /usr/plivo-devel and Run plivo_install.sh using following command: 
     #./plivo_install.sh /usr/local/plivo

  5. Go to /usr/local/plivo/bin directory and Run plivo service using the following command:
     #./plivo start


ICTDialer Software Installation
-------------------------------
Download and extract ictdialer.tar.gz archive.
Locate the folder "wwwroot" in the extracted ICTdialer directory. 
Rename this folder to ictdialer and copy-paste it to /usr directory.

* Database Installation:
  Create "ictdialer" database in mysql (Run 'CREATE DATABASE ictdialer' query on mysql)

* Frontend / Web GUI
  
  1. Create a symbolic link for /usr/ictdialer in /var/www/html 
       ln -s /usr/ictdialer /var/www/html/ictdialer
  
  2. Now visit http://DOMAIN.TLD/ictdialer 
     and follow the installation instructions for 
     ICTDialer (drupal based) front end installation.
     
  3. Once you are done with installation, visit the website 
     and login as site administrator with username and password 
     that you provided during installation.
     
  4. Now copy the "Broadcast" folder and place it somewhere in 
     your drupal installation (that you named ictdialer) 
     preferably in modules/ folder or sites/all/modules/ folder
  
  4. Now comback to Web GUI and go to Modules menu and enable all modules in "ICTDialer System" Package.
